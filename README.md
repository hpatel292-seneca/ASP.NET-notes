# ASP.NET-notes

### **Domain Models:**
- **Definition:** Domain models represent the core entities or objects in your application's business logic. These models directly map to the concepts or things in the problem domain (the real world or the business you are working with).
- **Purpose:** Domain models are used to interact with the database and manage business rules. They often mirror the structure of your database tables in applications using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tools like Entity Framework. 
- **Example:**
  - If you are building an e-commerce application, domain models could include `Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, etc.
  - For instance, a `Customer` domain model might look like:
    ```csharp
    public class Customer
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; }
    }
    ```

### **View Models:**
- **Definition:** View models are data transfer objects (DTOs) designed specifically for the presentation layer (the user interface). They contain only the data that is needed for the UI, making them lighter and more focused compared to domain models.
- **Purpose:** View models simplify the data that is sent to the front end (or received from the front end). They decouple the domain/business models from the user interface, ensuring that sensitive data (e.g., passwords) or unnecessary data (e.g., internal system information) is not exposed.
- **Example:**
  - In the same e-commerce application, a view model could represent only the necessary data for displaying customer information on the UI. For instance, a `CustomerBaseViewModel` might only include basic information:
    ```csharp
    public class CustomerBaseViewModel
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
    }
    ```

### **Differences between Domain Models and View Models:**
1. **Purpose:**
   - **Domain Models:** Represent the structure of your business or database entities. They often include relationships between objects (e.g., a customer having multiple orders).
   - **View Models:** Simplified objects used for displaying data in the user interface. They may omit fields that are unnecessary for the UI or sensitive to business logic.
   
2. **Usage:**
   - **Domain Models:** Used internally in your application's business logic or to interact with a database.
   - **View Models:** Used to transfer data between the controller and the view/UI. They are mapped from domain models but serve a presentation-specific purpose.

3. **Structure:**
   - **Domain Models:** Can include all properties related to the business entity, including relationships (e.g., orders for a customer).
   - **View Models:** Typically contain only the information required by the view (e.g., a customer’s name and email but not their orders).


Yes, you're exactly right! The purpose of **AutoMapper** is to simplify the process of converting (or **mapping**) between **domain models** and **view models** (or other data transfer objects, DTOs). AutoMapper automates this process, avoiding the need to manually copy properties between these objects. Let me explain how this works step-by-step:

### **Purpose of AutoMapper:**
AutoMapper is a library that helps you:
1. **Map domain models to view models** (and vice versa).
2. **Automatically handle data transformation** between objects that have similar or related structures.
3. **Reduce boilerplate code** that you would otherwise write manually to transfer data from one model to another.

### **Typical Workflow with AutoMapper:**
Here’s how AutoMapper fits into the flow:

1. **Domain Model and Data Fetching**:
   - First, you fetch data from the database using a **domain model**. The domain model often has all the data, including relationships, detailed properties, and sensitive information that are part of the business logic.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class Customer
     {
         public int Id { get; set; }
         public string Name { get; set; }
         public string Email { get; set; }
         public string PasswordHash { get; set; }  // Sensitive data
         public ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; }  // Relationships
     }
     ```

2. **Mapping Domain Model to View Model**:
   - After fetching the **domain model**, you map it to a **view model** using AutoMapper.
   - The view model contains **only the data needed for the UI**, so you strip out unnecessary or sensitive fields (e.g., `PasswordHash`).
   - AutoMapper automates the mapping of fields with the same or similar names between the domain model and the view model.
   - Example of View Model:
     ```csharp
     public class CustomerBaseViewModel
     {
         public int Id { get; set; }
         public string Name { get; set; }
         public string Email { get; set; }  // Only what UI needs
     }
     ```

   - AutoMapper setup:
     ```csharp
     var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg =>
     {
         cfg.CreateMap<Customer, CustomerBaseViewModel>();
     });
     var mapper = config.CreateMapper();
     ```

   - Using AutoMapper to map the domain model to the view model:
     ```csharp
     var customerViewModels = mapper.Map<IEnumerable<Customer>, IEnumerable<CustomerBaseViewModel>>(customers);
     ```

3. **Displaying the View Model in the UI**:
   - The view model is sent to the UI, and it **only contains the data that the view needs** (e.g., customer name, email). This ensures that sensitive or irrelevant data is not exposed to the front end.

4. **Receiving Input (Reverse Mapping)**:
   - When the user submits a form (e.g., adding or editing a customer), the input data is often sent as a **view model** (such as `CustomerAddViewModel`).
   - You then use AutoMapper to map the **view model back to the domain model**.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     var newCustomer = mapper.Map<CustomerAddViewModel, Customer>(customerAddViewModel);
     ```

   - You can then use the `newCustomer` object to save it in the database.

### **Key Benefits of AutoMapper:**
1. **Reduces Boilerplate Code**: Without AutoMapper, you'd have to manually map each property from the domain model to the view model and vice versa. AutoMapper handles this for you, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
   - Example of manual mapping without AutoMapper:
     ```csharp
     var customerViewModel = new CustomerBaseViewModel
     {
         Id = customer.Id,
         Name = customer.Name,
         Email = customer.Email
     };
     ```

2. **Consistent and Maintainable**: AutoMapper ensures that mappings are handled consistently across your application. If your model changes (e.g., you add or remove properties), you only need to update the mappings in one place.

3. **Separation of Concerns**: The domain model remains focused on the business logic and data storage, while the view model is optimized for displaying data in the UI. AutoMapper bridges these two models seamlessly.

### **Summary:**
- **Domain Models** represent all the data fetched from the database, including sensitive and detailed information.
- **View Models** contain only the necessary information required for the UI, making the data lighter and more secure.
- **AutoMapper** automatically maps domain models to view models and vice versa, saving you from writing repetitive code and ensuring that only the required data is sent to the front end.

In short, AutoMapper helps you **extract only the needed data** from your domain model and pass it to the view in a clean and efficient way.
